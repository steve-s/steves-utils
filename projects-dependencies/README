Takes a visual studio 2010 solution and produces a DOT file describing a graph 
of dependencies of all the visual studio 2010 project files included in 
the solution.

This DOT file can be then processed by GraphViz to generate "visually pleasing" 
graph of all the dependencies.

No need to build the solution.
