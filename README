This utility can

1) compare (diff) API exposed by two .NET assemblies and produce report 
on which types/methods are missing in one or the other.

2) seach .NET assembly for methods that instantiate NotImplementedException.

Usage:
API differences: apicmp [-all] assembly1 assembly2
Seek NotImplementedExceptions: apicmp [-all] assembly

With -all option, the program takes into account even private and 
internal types and methods.
