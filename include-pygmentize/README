Alternative to minted (http://code.google.com/p/minted/) that allows you to 
easily include pygments (http://pygments.org/) output in your latex files.

Syntax is following:

%----------------
%in preamble:

%pygmentize_options: -O style=vs

%----------------
%anywhere in your latex source:

%pygmentize_begin csharp
% class Immutable {
%   public string Name { get; private set; }
% }
%pygmentize_end

Latex file with these special comments can be then processed by 
include-pygmentize.exe and a new file with pygmentize output will be produced 
(but it will still contain the comments).


Differences from Minted:
	+ it is not needed to run pygmentize everytime you compile your latex file, 
		if you don't change source code listings
	+ it seems to be faster
	+ the latex source is not dependent on include-pygmentize.exe, only 
		editing of source code listings will be bit difficult
	- it does not support as advanced options as Minted does
	- it is not as easy to use
